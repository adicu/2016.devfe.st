  - question: "Do I need experience?"
    answer: "Students of all experience levels are welcome! New hackers can learn to build websites with our Beginner Track, and experienced hackers can expand their skillsets by working on the Web Development Track, iOS Development Track, Game Development Track, Data Science Track, or Product Track."
  - question: "Do I have to come to the entire week?"

  - question: "Do I need to be there the whole week to participate?"
